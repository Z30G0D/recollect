## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Scan for Apps:** Finds all `.app` bundles in standard macOS locations.
2. **Describe & Match:** You describe the app you want; Recollect uses ChatGPT to match your description to the best app.
3. **Ask About Apps:** Select any app and ask ChatGPT for more info.
4. **Caching:** App descriptions are saved in `app_descriptions_cache.json` for faster future runs.
